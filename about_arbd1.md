## About ARBD1
ArBrd1 is a board designed by <a href="https://hatchnhack.com/">Hatchnhack</a> that aims to help one develop Arduino skills starting from the introductory to advanced levels.
It has all the rudimentary components that one comes across while experimenting and prototyping with Arduino.
ArBrd1 is especially useful for absolute beginners, whether they are school students or college students.


## Why ARBD1 ?
Many students start their journey with Arduino with loads of curiosity and enthusiasm but end up jumping off the boat too soon
mainly due to the following reasons:
  - A lot of components are required with time and arranging all the components is a tedious task
  - Most students including school students, different engineering branches’ students and even almost half of the electronics students struggle with hardware. They find it difficult to understand so much hardware before even using it.
  - Circuits such as LCD connections, Charlieplexing, Multiplexing require so many connections that no matter how much care you make your connections with, some wires would still remain loose and you end up with a lot of frustration and waste a lot of time.

With ArBrd1, students wouldn’t have to struggle with hardware complexity and wire connections at the beginning of their journey.
Whenever your circuits don’t work, you don’t have a clue whether there is a problem in your components, in your connections or in the code. With this board, you will know for sure that there is a problem in your code whenever it does not work.

## How to use ARBD1

There are many ways to use this board. 
If you are an absolute beginner and want to learn everything step-by-step, you can follow the manual. 
This board and manual are designed in such a way that you can start from the very basics and learn a lot of things about Arduino, sensors, actuators and basic electronics. After getting acquainted with this board, you can make a lot of real-life applications based projects that can even interact with your surroundings and communicate with your mobile and laptop.

If you have worked with Arduino before or don’t want to follow the manual, 
you can still do a lot of experiments of your own choice or from our list( listed separately in manual under “Experiments List.”)
You can still use this manual as this contains a lot of information not only about Arduino but also about other interfaces and their connections.

You can use this board for experimentation as well as project purposes.
